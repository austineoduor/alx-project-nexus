IMPROMENT TO BE DONE
1. Recommendation Engine
    Content-based filtering
    Recommend movies similar to what the user has already favorited, using TMDb genres, keywords, or similarity scores.
    Collaborative filtering
    Recommend movies based on what similar users have liked (could use libraries like Surprise or lightfm later).

2. ✅Search & Filtering
    Search movies by title, genre, or release year.
    Filter favorites list by genre or date added.

3. ✅Watchlist Feature
    Add a separate Watchlist model for movies the user plans to watch (not just favorites).

4. User Profile Enhancements
    Add profile picture uploads (via django-storages with S3 or local media).
    Track total number of movies in favorites and watchlist.

5. ✅Activity History
    Keep logs of when users favorite/unfavorite a movie.
    Display "Recently Added" and "Recently Removed" lists.

6. ✅Ratings & Reviews
    Allow users to rate movies (1–5 stars) and leave short reviews.
    Aggregate ratings to show an average score per movie.

7. ✅API Performance
    Implement Redis caching for TMDb API calls.
    Add pagination for large lists (favorites, search results).

8. Security & Auth
    Add email verification during signup.
    Implement password reset and change password endpoints.

9. UI/UX
    Swagger is good for API docs, but you could add a simple React frontend to make it demo-friendly.

10. Analytics Dashboard
    Track:
        Most favorited movies.
        Most active users.
        Top genres.
    Display via /admin or a custom dashboard API.

Got it ✅
Here’s a **compact, chronological summary** of what we’ve built and fixed so far so you can close the tab without losing context.

---

## **Movie & TMDb Integration**

* **Movie model** has `tmdb_id`, `title`, `overview`, `poster_path`.
* **`fetch_tmdb_details` method** automatically pulls extra info from TMDb if `tmdb_id` is set.
* **MovieSerializer** saves TMDb `id` into `tmdb_id` and relies on the model’s save method to fetch details.
* **`MovieListCreateView`** modified so:

  * If `id` exists in incoming JSON and `tmdb_id` not given → set `tmdb_id`.
  * Prevent duplicates (`tmdb_id` unique check).
  * Trigger model save for TMDb fetch.

---

## **Favorite Movies**

* **AddFavoriteSerializer** accepts TMDb movie info (`tmdb_id`, `title`, `overview`, `poster_path`).
* Inside `.create()`:

  * `Movie.objects.get_or_create()` by `tmdb_id`.
  * `FavoriteMovie.objects.get_or_create()` for `(user, movie)`.
* Validation ensures `tmdb_id` exists before creation.
* Fix for `null movie_id` error → serializer always attaches a valid `Movie` instance.

---

## **Rating Movies**

* **RateMovieView** allows users to rate movies.
* Validates that a movie exists for given `tmdb_id` before saving the rating.

---

## **Watchlist**

* **WatchlistSerializer** only requires `tmdb_id`, `title`, `overview`, `poster_path` (no direct `movie_id` from client).
* **WatchlistView**:

  * Lists authenticated user’s watchlist.
  * Allows adding a movie → `perform_create` auto-sets `user`.
  * Swagger docs show full request body, not just `movie_id`.

---

## **Planned Improvement**

* Option to require **only `tmdb_id`** in API calls → backend fetches `title`, `overview`, `poster_path` from TMDb automatically.

---

## **Outstanding**

* Memory usage in browser is high due to long chat history — safest fix is **close tab and rejoin later with this summary**.
* You’ll need to **paste this summary** back into the new chat so I instantly know where we left off.

---

Do you want me to **already rewrite Watchlist & FavoriteMovie serializers** so they work with only `tmdb_id` and auto-fetch the rest from TMDb? That way when you reopen, they’re ready.
